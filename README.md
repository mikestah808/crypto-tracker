# Crypto Tracker


# Overview

Here is a React application that mimics a crypto tracker due to my strong passion for cryptocurrency! I would love to work more within this space and anything that has to do with blockchain and Web3. I hope you enjoy! :)

# Requirements 

* Uses Node version 16.11.1.
* Uses npm version 8.6.0.
* Must install json-server.
* Single Page Application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.
* 5 components minimum to keep code organized. 
* At least 3 client-side routes using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/).
* Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
* Add some CSS styling. Either create styling from scratch and/or incorporate a UI framework (like [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/),[Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), or [Material UI](https://mui.com/)).

# Installation

* Fork and clone repo
* Open project, run npm install (if you used npx)
* Run npm start 

# Features 

* Navigation (Navbar)
* Contains Home Page which lists the top 20 cryptocurrencies 
* Sign up page which lets you create an account

* Search Bar that matches the crypto typed in 
* Change in crypto quantity and price amount when plus or minus button is clicked

# Conclusion 

Learning React was thoroughly challenging, yet very rewarding once I started to get the hang of it. I look forward to learning more as I get further into my flatiron curriculum and learn backend next. I plan to continue adding to this project as crypto is a passion of mine!
